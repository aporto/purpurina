Purpurina means "Glitter" in Brazilian Portuguese

This project aims to create a led stick to support light-painting photography.

Light-painting is a photographic technique where the camera is pointed to a dark background while put on large shutter time. Then we move a light source around the background to draw over that image. When the shutter finally closes, we have the image we drew bright over the background.

How this project works: A set of Arduino-controlled RGB leds are lined on a stick. The leds represents a row of pixels from a user-selected image. When the stick is moved, the pixels/leds change to represent the other image lines. When the stick reaches the last movement position, the camera shall get the fully image over the photo background.

This project includes the Arduino software, the circuit diagrams and PCB layout and the PC software responsible to send the images to Arduino.
